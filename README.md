# Observer pattern

The observer pattern is a behavioural design pattern that enables you to define a subscription mechanism to notify objects on any events that occur on the object they are observing.

In other words is an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. In those systems, the subject is usually named a "stream of events" or "stream source of events", while the observers are called "sinks of events".
